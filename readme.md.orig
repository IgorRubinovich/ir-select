# iron-select

## Tagging-style multiselect box for Polymer 1.0

This is a tagging-style custom element built entirely from the ground up on [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org) and iron-components.
Aims to provide the same functionality as Selectize, Chosen2 and friends, using only vanilla JS and Polymer.

This component is functional but is still a work in progress. Pull requests are welcome.

# Native form integration
You might have been puzzled about how exactly a non-native component may be submitted as part of a static form. You might also be aware that it's not possibble to append child elements to input elements. Thus it's not possible to enrich an input with shadow dom. 

iron-select solves this by adding a hidden native input to the  form it belongs to, and reflecting its .value property to the hidden field. The name of the hidden field is determined by iron-input  You know the rest of the story.

## Key todos:
* Currently expects a raw array of objects from remote data source. Add an optional transform parameter with callback to traverse any server response.
* Support multi = false
* More eventing
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
* Custom target field (to optionally  replace the autogenerated hidden field desribed [above](#native-form-integration))
>>>>>>> feature/native-reflection
* Better docs
* Tests
* Demo
* Proper packaging for customelements.io
